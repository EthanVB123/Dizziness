# Dizziness
A questionnaire for the World College of Neurology to take in patients.

# Goal
To update the paper form to a HTML Form, and then save the results to a PDF.
### Secondary Goal
If time remains, it would be nice to output a PDF Report.

# Progress Updates

### 08/01 04:15PM
Finished with the main problem section of the questionnaire. Making reasonable time, secondary goal looking unlikely
### 08/01 12:35PM
Constructed a basic form with a few questions on it.
Got a button that downloads a text file based off of the name.
Solid progress!
